## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v22 LTS — https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Git — https://git-scm.com/
- Visual Studio Code (recommended) — https://code.visualstudio.com/

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rajit270901/sampleapp_IFN636.git
cd sampleapp_IFN636
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder with:

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=5001
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:

```bash
Server running on port 5001
MongoDB connected successfully
```

### Frontend Setup

In a separate terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The application opens at http://localhost:3000

---

### Setup Instructions for Windows

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js v22 LTS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Git for Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

**Clone the Repository:**

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Rajit270901/sampleapp_IFN636.git
cd sampleapp_IFN636
```

**Backend Setup (Windows):**

```cmd
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a file named `.env` in the backend folder. In File Explorer, right-click → New → Text Document → rename to `.env` (remove the .txt extension; click Yes if Windows warns).

Open `.env` in Notepad and paste:

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
PORT=5001
```

Start the backend:

```cmd
node server.js
```

You should see "Server running on port 5001" and "MongoDB connected successfully". Leave the window open.

**Frontend Setup (Windows):**

Open a SECOND Command Prompt or PowerShell window:

```cmd
cd sampleapp_IFN636\frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The application opens at http://localhost:3000

**Common Windows Issues:**

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| "node is not recognized" | Restart terminal after Node.js install |
| Port 5001 already in use | Task Manager → end node.exe processes |
| Permission errors | Run terminal as Administrator |
| Frontend doesn't auto-open | Manually navigate to http://localhost:3000 |
| .env file shows as test.txt | View → File name extensions in Explorer |

## Test Credentials

The following test accounts are available at the live application URL:

**Patient Account:**
- Email: `patient@meditrack.com`
- Password: `patient1234`

**Admin Account:**
- Email: `admin@meditrack.com`
- Password: `admin1234`

Patients can browse doctors, view slots, book/manage appointments and access notifications. Admins can manage doctors, slots and appointments.

---

## Authentication and Authorization

MediTrack uses JWT based authentication.

**Roles:**
- `patient` — access to patient dashboard, doctor browsing and booking functions
- `admin` — access to admin dashboard, doctor/slot management and all appointments view

Route protection is enforced both on the backend (middleware) and the frontend (route guards in `App.js`).

---

## GitHub Version Control and Branching

Development followed a feature-branch workflow with pull requests required for all merges to `main`:

- All changes were made on feature branches 
- Pull requests were opened against `main` with clear commit messages
- The GitHub Actions CI workflow ran on every push to feature branches and on every PR to `main`
- Each merge to `main` automatically triggered deployment to the production EC2 instances via the self-hosted GitHub Actions runner

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

A GitHub Actions workflow named "Backend CI" is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Push to any `feature/**` branch
- Pull requests targeting `main`

**Workflow Steps:**
1. Checkout the repository
2. Setup Node.js v22 with dependency caching
3. Install backend dependencies
4. Run the mocha test suite 
5. Build the frontend
6. Stop, restart and verify PM2 processes on the production EC2

Deployment to EC2 is automated through a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner installed on Server 1. This enables continuous delivery — code merged to main is automatically deployed to the load balanced production environment.

---

## Production Deployment

The application is deployed on AWS using two EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer with CloudWatch monitoring.

**Live Application URL (Application Load Balancer):**  
http://MediTrack-ALB-291180955.ap-southeast-2.elb.amazonaws.com

**Architecture:**

- **Two EC2 t3.micro instances** running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Node.js v22, PM2 and Nginx reverse proxy
- **AWS Application Load Balancer** distributing traffic across both instances with health checks every 30 seconds
- **MongoDB Atlas** (free tier M0 cluster) for the database
- **GitHub Actions self-hosted runner** for automated CI/CD on every merge to main
- **AWS CloudWatch** monitoring CPU and network metrics with a configured alarm
- **AWS SNS** for email notification delivery when alarms trigger
- **Apache Bench** used to validate load distribution and performance characteristics

**Load Testing Results:**
- Baseline (100 requests, 10 concurrent): ~80 RPS, 127 ms mean latency, 0 failures
- Stress (1000 requests, 100 concurrent): ~80 RPS, 1237 ms mean latency, 0 failures

The throughput remained constant under stress while latency increased linearly with concurrency demonstrating behaviour of a properly load balanced system.
